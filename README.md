Women are weird - yes means no , no means yes and a yes after a no is called maybe ! This one predicts the real expected answer they want
and save your self some lectures even though you do exactly what you are told

## Why am I doing this ?

My mom keeps yelling at me **everytime** no matter what I do . She asks me to buy some bread and when I am back home I get scolded for not getting milk. Damn ! a million other things . So  I thought of creating an artificial intelligence to sort of **predict** which is the best / most suitable answer to give when a question is asked :P

## When will I do this ?

I am hoping to do it right after my exams using Tensorflow library in Python. But the learning curve is pretty steep so if you can do it before, you are most welcome to manage this project ! 

## Thanks for taking interest in this and thanks for reading !
